## 🏆 Competition Summary

We competed in the **Inovedex 2025** competition hosted at the **Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology** in Bangkok.  
There were **140 teams** in total from across Thailand, competing over **two days**.  

We won the **Grand Prize** of **10,000 Baht** 🏆 and will be using it to sponsor our future robotics competitions and projects.

## 📐 Design & Engineering

I (**Captain**) went through **three iterations** of designs before settling on the **SACRA arm** concept for its **easy kinematics and tuning**.  
This proved extremely advantageous, as no other teams used the SACRA arm design.  

I even saw **five teams** from different schools using the same competitive design and code — which we were able to outperform.

Here, I’ve published the **Fusion 360** and **STEP** files in the hope that someone will improve upon my designs further.

## 🛠 Lessons Learned

- Us choosing an **uncommon but effective mechanical design** gave our team a major competitive advantage.
- Iterating **multiple times before the event** allowed for better mechanical reliability and proof testing.
- In competition, **not being the fastest might make you lose sometimes, but being unrealiable will make you lose every time.**
